## Planned features
### Mandatory features
#### Basic store functionalities for devs and users
Implemented by dividing the site to functional parts. These parts include the 
following sites: login/logout, add a new game (devs), game browser, buy a game,
owned games browser and play a game.
#### Game/service interaction
By using  iFrame container for games and postMessages for communications.
#### Non-functional requirements
Includes project plan, use case -diagram, class-diagram and feature documentation.
### Optional features
#### 3rd party login
Achieved by using 3rd party django app [django-social-auth](https://github.com/omab/django-social-auth) or similar. 
#### Save/load and resolution feature
Achieved by creating an additional database model that stores the game state information.
#### RESTful API
Making possible to request various data from database in JSON format.
#### Testing your service with other groupsâ€™ games
Testing by breaking: intentionally misusing the website and the game in order to find bugs.

## Working plan
Our plan is to meet at the start of the project and operate remotely for the rest of the project. Trello and Slack are used for communication and taskkeeping. Project will be divided into modules so that can be easily worked.
